Simple tool to learn the most 100 commonly used italian words.

## Background
When learning a language, the core vocabularly is important. In English, the 25 most commonly used words make up a third of all printed material in the language.<sup>[1]</sup> As such, assuming similar rates for Italian the top 100 words form an important basis for being able to read and understand sentences.

## Issues/Notes
 - All accents on letters have been removed.
 - Where there are multiple ways to say one thing (e.g. masculine/feminine/plural) only one is used
 - Learning the words off of wrote memorisation in this way can lose the context of the way the words are used.
 - Verbs have not been conjugated.
